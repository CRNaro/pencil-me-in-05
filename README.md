Schedule/organizer


## Table of Content

## Description

I find myself needing to keep track of my projects and schedule time to get everything that I need to finished before the day ends.  This project of a day planner should help.

## Usage

<Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.>
App instructions begin with loading the app from the provided URL. Scroll to the current time and notice that the color indicates time of the day.  Past time is gray, present time is red and future time is green.  You can post a project or event in any of the text boxes provided.  Then click the save button provided to the right to save your project or event in that time slot.  As the day progresses the color change should help to remind you that your event is coming up.  Once project is finished, you may delete the text and then press save to save the open box.  Note that saving text or deleted text will save even if the page is refreshed.
